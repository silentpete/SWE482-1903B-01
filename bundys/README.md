# bundys

## Files

The `bundys.go` file is wrote in Googles Go language. This language can be compiled into a portable binary file.

The `Dockerfile` is used as the build file for the Bundys container. This process puts the compiled binary in a static predictable environment.

The `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are used for dependency versioning.

The `invnetory.json` file is used to load the database with default values.
